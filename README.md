# Laying Grass


1 - Introduction

This project is based on the "Laying Grass" board game from The Devil's Plan (데블스 플랜) Netflix reality game show (episode 8).

It has been realized using C++ programming language with a graphical user interface where the player can play.

2 - Presentation

Laying Grass is a board game with a grid where the player's main objective is to create the largest territory using tiles of different sizes.
At the start of the game, players choose a name and color and receive a 1x1 coin and a tile exchange coupon. (A tile exchange coupon allows you to choose a different tile from the one assigned to you on your turn). The order of the tiles is predetermined, but remains random. On each turn, players receive a grass tile. They can choose to place it on the grid, or use a tile swap coupon to choose one of the next 5 tiles in line. To be placed, a tile must touch a grass tile already on the grid and forming part of its territory. It's important to note that once a tile has been placed, it can't be moved, and no tile can overlap. In this game, tiles can be turned in any direction. 
In addition, the tiles of different players cannot touch.
This version of the game features 97 different-sized pieces. The game has a total of 9 turns per game (i.e. 9 tiles per player). The winning player is the one with the largest territory of grass tiles on the grid.
